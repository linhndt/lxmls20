## The 10th Lisbon Machine Learning School 2020 materials.

Every summer, I always register for at least one summer school (Science, Economics, Maths, etc.). In this summer, with a golden opportunity to study aboard in the EU, I did apply and was successfully admitted to Lisbon and Oxford summer schools in Machine Learning. However, due to the Covid19, all summer schools have gone virtually. 

LxMLS 2020 will take place July 21st to July 29th at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST), a leading Engineering and Science school in Portugal. It is organized jointly by IST, the Instituto de Telecomunicações, the Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores, Investigação e Desenvolvimento em Lisboa (INESC-ID), Unbabel, Priberam Labs and Cleverly. 

Hereby are the materials I collected from the LxMLS2020, which are also made publicly. Non-attendants can have access to the lectures and talks [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkVFZWgT1jR75UvSLGP9_mw/videos).

Check it out and have fun!
